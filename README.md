**AI usage and written technical responses**

One technical concept I developed greater mastery over during this project was CSS layout using Flexbox and positioning to structure a responsive page.
Mental Model
I understand Flexbox as a way to organize elements along a main axis and a cross axis, where a parent container controls how its children are aligned, spaced, and sized. Instead of manually positioning elements, Flexbox lets me describe relationships between elements — such as whether they should sit in a row or column, how space should be distributed, and how items should align relative to each other.
I also learned that layout works best when HTML provides clear structure (sections, containers, semantic elements) and CSS controls how that structure is displayed visually. Separating structure from presentation made my code easier to reason about and modify.
How I Used It in My Project
I used Flexbox throughout my portfolio to align navigation links, organize content sections, and center elements both vertically and horizontally. For example, my header/navigation bar uses Flexbox to space items evenly and keep them aligned across different screen sizes. I also used Flexbox in sections like my project cards and contact form to control spacing, alignment, and responsiveness without relying on fixed positioning.
This helped me build a layout that adapts better to different screen sizes and made my CSS more readable and maintainable.
Challenging Project Requirement
One project requirement I found challenging — and am proud of implementing — was creating styled components such as cards (comic-style boxes) and a functional form with consistent design and layout.
Why It Was Challenging
As a beginner, it was difficult to translate a visual idea into structured HTML and layered CSS. I initially struggled with deciding:
how many containers I actually needed,
which elements should be grouped together,
and how to apply styles without breaking other parts of the page.
I also had to learn how padding, margins, borders, and animations interact, which took trial and error.
How I Implemented It
I approached this by breaking each component into smaller parts:
HTML structure: I created a container element for each card or form section, with clear child elements for headings, text, and inputs.
Base styling: I applied consistent font styles, colors, borders, and spacing to create a unified look.
Layout control: I used Flexbox inside the containers to align content cleanly and ensure spacing stayed consistent.
Enhancements: I added animations and hover effects to make the design more interactive without overwhelming the user.
By building each piece step by step and testing changes incrementally, I was able to meet the requirement while gaining confidence in reading and adjusting my own code.
AI Usage Reflection
I leveraged AI as a learning and support tool, not as a replacement for understanding or writing my project.
Specifically, I used ChatGPT to:
understand how to create basic HTML elements such as forms,
explore CSS design options including animations, fonts, and layout ideas,
troubleshoot layout issues by asking why something wasn’t behaving as expected,
and get examples that helped me visualize how different CSS properties work together.
Rather than copying code blindly, I used AI responses as references and explanations. I tested changes, modified examples to fit my project, and learned through experimentation. This helped reinforce concepts like layout, spacing, and styling, and made me more confident in reading and editing HTML and CSS on my own.
